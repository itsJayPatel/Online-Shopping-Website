Worked on the project titled ‘Online Shopping’ for better understanding of backend
and Node.js.Project consists of various modules such as user, seller, admin,
authentication, validation, session management, and route protection. Project is built
using MVC architecture. As the name suggests, project is all about showing products to
users, adding products to cart, booking orders, adding products by seller, editing and
deleting products, login and signup process for users and sellers, and showing errors for
invalid inputs. Use of templates is shown in this projects for generating dynamic web
pages. Sequelize is used for the database connectiveity with mysql. So, without writing
single line SQL queries, with the help of various methods and functions provided by
sequelize. And also make association between two models very easily. Route Protection is
also important to prevent visiting secured routes from any unauthenticated user. So, this
modules are studied and practically implemented during internship.
